## Project Features

### Model Building, Training, Evaluation, and Selection Process for Regression

*Objective:* Help the company decide whether to invest in improving the website or the mobile app by analyzing customer engagement data.

### Problem Statement & Data Source

An e-commerce company sells products through its website and mobile app. Customers can create accounts on either platform and log in to make purchases. The system records the amount of time each customer spends logged in, either on the website or the mobile app. Given budget constraints, the company can only invest in either the website or the mobile app to enhance customer experience. The task is to analyze the data and provide recommendations on where to focus investment for increasing engagement, logged-in time, and consequently, sales.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the development of a regression model to analyze customer engagement data for an e-commerce platform. By comparing engagement on the website and the mobile app, the company can make data-driven decisions on where to focus their investment to enhance customer experience and increase sales.
